# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)
Implementing commonly use DSA using JS, helpfull in solving MAANG & top tech interview problems.

- ### [Trie](https://github.com/akshaykhanna/DSA/blob/main/Trie.js)
- ### [Union Find](https://github.com/akshaykhanna/DSA/blob/main/UnionFind.js) (aka Disjoint Set)
- ### Algorithm to Construct Minimum Spanning Tree
  #### Minimum spanning tree
  A **spanning tree** is a connected subgraph in an undirected graph where all vertices are connected with the minimum number of edge.
  A **minimum spanning tree** is a spanning tree with the minimum possible total edge weight in a “weighted undirected graph”.
